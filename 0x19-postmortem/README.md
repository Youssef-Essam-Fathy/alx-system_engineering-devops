**Postmortem Title: Web Application Outage Incident Report**

**Date: April 14, 2024**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 8 hours, from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM (UTC).
- **Impact:** The outage affected our primary web application, resulting in complete unavailability for all users. Approximately 75% of our user base experienced service disruptions, leading to frustration and loss of productivity.
- **Root Cause:** The outage was caused by a database server failure due to unexpected hardware malfunction.

**Timeline:**
- **10:00 AM:** The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a sudden drop in database connectivity.
- **10:05 AM:** Engineers began investigating the issue, suspecting a potential database misconfiguration or network issue.
- **10:30 AM:** Initial investigations revealed no abnormalities in database configurations or network settings.
- **11:00 AM:** Attention shifted to the database server hardware after noticing intermittent disk read/write errors in system logs.
- **11:30 AM:** Further diagnostics confirmed hardware failure on the primary database server, necessitating escalation to senior infrastructure engineers.
- **12:00 PM:** Incident escalated to senior infrastructure engineers and database administrators for immediate resolution.
- **2:00 PM:** After exhaustive attempts to revive the failed hardware, it was determined that a complete replacement of the database server was necessary.
- **4:00 PM:** Replacement hardware was procured and deployed, with data recovery and restoration procedures initiated.
- **6:00 PM:** Web application services were fully restored, and normal operation resumed.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was identified as a hardware malfunction on the primary database server, specifically involving disk storage subsystem failure.
- **Resolution:** The issue was resolved by replacing the faulty hardware components and restoring data from backups onto the new database server. Additionally, redundant failover mechanisms were implemented to minimize the impact of similar hardware failures in the future.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement proactive hardware monitoring to detect early signs of impending failures.
  - Enhance failover capabilities to ensure seamless transition to backup systems during hardware outages.
